# Techcetera
An experimental blog site. It has no "usual backend" or any "usual database" instead I've used browser's local storage as database and vanilla JS as "backend"(Actually it isn't a backend more like scripts but it is connecting the front-end with "database" ).

One can create blogs with text and image URL which will be stored on the browser's local storage locally. Then the blogs will be shown on the "Posts" section.

It is one of my very first works so it still needs some improvements on styles and on other things.
